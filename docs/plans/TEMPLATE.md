# <Implementation Plan Title>

- Status: draft
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Scope: <ADR or roadmap slice>

## Objective

1. ...
2. ...

## Status Quo Baseline

Capture current behavior with explicit evidence links.

1. Baseline metric or trace A.
2. Baseline metric or trace B.
3. Baseline metric or trace C.

## Expected Improvements

State measurable deltas from the baseline.

1. Metric X from `<baseline>` to `<target>`.
2. Metric Y from `<baseline>` to `<target>`.
3. Metric Z from `<baseline>` to `<target>`.

## Non-Improvement Expectations

State what should not regress.

1. Behavior A remains unchanged.
2. Behavior B remains unchanged.

## Validation Signals and Thresholds

1. Test suites/specs that must pass.
2. Trace scenarios and log fields to inspect.
3. Explicit pass/fail thresholds.
4. Minimum observation window.

## Rollback or Adjustment Triggers

1. Trigger condition A -> adjustment action A.
2. Trigger condition B -> rollback action B.
