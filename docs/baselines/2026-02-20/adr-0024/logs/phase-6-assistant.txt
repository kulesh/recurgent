> # Jaffna Kool

A traditional refreshing iced beverage from Jaffna, Sri Lanka, often enjoyed as a cooling drink or dessert.

## Ingredients:
- 1 cup palmyrah root flour (or substitute with rice flour)
- 1/2 cup sugar (adjust to taste)
- 4-5 cups water
- 1/2 tsp cardamom powder
- Ice cubes
- Optional: rose syrup, coconut milk, crushed ice

## Instructions:
1. Mix palmyrah root flour with 1 cup of water to make a smooth paste without lumps.
2. Boil 3-4 cups of water in a pot.
3. Slowly add the flour paste to boiling water, stirring continuously to prevent lumps.
4. Cook on medium heat for 10-15 minutes, stirring frequently until mixture thickens.
5. Add sugar and cardamom powder, stir well until sugar dissolves.
6. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature.
7. Pour into a container and refrigerate until fully chilled (2-3 hours).
8. To serve: Fill a glass with crushed ice, add the chilled kool mixture.
9. Optional: top with rose syrup, coconut milk, or additional ice as desired.
10. Mix well and enjoy cold!

## Notes:
• Palmyrah root flour gives authentic flavor but can be hard to find; rice flour is an acceptable substitute
• Some variations include adding jaggery instead of sugar for deeper flavor
• Can be stored refrigerated for 2-3 days
• Consistency should be slightly thick but pourable when chilled
