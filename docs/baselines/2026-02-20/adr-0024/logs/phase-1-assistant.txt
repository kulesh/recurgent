> # Jaffna Kool

A traditional Tamil seafood broth from the Jaffna peninsula in northern Sri Lanka. This hearty dish combines seafood, palmyra root flour, and aromatic spices in a rich, soupy consistency. Often enjoyed as a comforting street food or home-cooked meal.

## Ingredients:
- 500g mixed seafood (prawns, crab, squid, or fish)
- 1 cup palmyra root flour (or substitute with cornstarch/tapioca flour)
- 2 large onions, finely sliced
- 4-5 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 inch ginger, minced
- 2-3 green chilies, slit lengthwise
- 1 tsp black pepper, crushed
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 1/2 tsp fenugreek seeds
- 3-4 curry leaves sprigs
- 1 tsp turmeric powder
- 1 tsp chili powder (adjust to taste)
- 2 tomatoes, chopped
- 1/4 cup tamarind pulp (or juice of 1 lime)
- 6-8 cups water or seafood stock
- 3 tbsp coconut or vegetable oil
- Salt to taste
- Fresh coriander leaves for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Clean and prepare the seafood. Cut fish into chunks, devein prawns, and clean squid. Set aside.
2. Heat oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and fenugreek seeds, let them splutter.
3. Add sliced onions and curry leaves. Sauté until onions turn golden brown, about 8-10 minutes.
4. Add minced garlic, ginger, and green chilies. Sauté for 2-3 minutes until fragrant.
5. Add chopped tomatoes, turmeric powder, chili powder, and crushed black pepper. Cook until tomatoes soften, about 5 minutes.
6. Pour in 6-8 cups of water or seafood stock and bring to a boil.
7. In a separate bowl, mix palmyra root flour (or substitute flour) with 1 cup cold water to create a smooth paste without lumps.
8. Once the broth is boiling, slowly pour the flour mixture into the pot while stirring continuously to prevent lumps from forming.
9. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally. The mixture will thicken to a porridge-like consistency.
10. Add the prepared seafood to the pot. Cook for 8-10 minutes until seafood is fully cooked (prawns turn pink, fish is opaque).
11. Stir in tamarind pulp or lime juice. Add salt to taste.
12. Simmer for another 3-5 minutes to allow flavors to meld together.
13. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and serve hot.

## Notes:
Traditional Jaffna Kool uses palmyra root flour (odiyal flour), which gives it a distinctive texture and flavor. If unavailable, cornstarch or tapioca flour work as substitutes, though the texture will be slightly different. The consistency should be soupy but thick enough to coat a spoon. Adjust the amount of water based on your preferred thickness. This dish is traditionally eaten with your hands, mixing the seafood and broth together. Some versions include additional vegetables like drumsticks or eggplant.
