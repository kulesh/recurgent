# ADR XXXX: <Title>

- Status: proposed
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Context

Describe the architectural problem and why current behavior is insufficient.

## Decision

Describe the chosen approach and decision boundaries.

## Status Quo Baseline

Document current behavior with concrete evidence.

1. Baseline metric or trace A.
2. Baseline metric or trace B.
3. Baseline metric or trace C.

## Expected Improvements

State measurable hypotheses as deltas from baseline.

1. Metric X improves from `<baseline>` to `<target>`.
2. Metric Y improves from `<baseline>` to `<target>`.
3. Metric Z improves from `<baseline>` to `<target>`.

## Non-Improvement Expectations

State what should remain unchanged.

1. Behavior A remains unchanged.
2. Behavior B remains unchanged.

## Validation Signals

Define objective confirmation signals.

1. Tests: suites/specs that must pass.
2. Traces/logs: fields and scenarios to inspect.
3. Thresholds: explicit pass/fail criteria.
4. Observation window: minimum calls/sessions/time range.

## Rollback or Adjustment Triggers

Define when to tune or roll back.

1. Trigger condition A -> action A.
2. Trigger condition B -> action B.
