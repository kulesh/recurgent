# Support Policy

## Scope

Support is best-effort and prioritized for:

1. Reproducible runtime bugs in [`runtimes/ruby`](../runtimes/ruby).
2. Contract/documentation mismatches under [`specs/contract/`](../specs/contract).
3. Security issues reported via [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md).

## What to Include in Bug Reports

1. Minimal reproduction snippet.
2. Runtime and Ruby versions.
3. Exact command output (`rspec`, `rubocop`, or runtime error trace).
4. Expected vs actual behavior.

## Response Expectations

1. Maintainers triage issues in priority order.
2. Time-to-response is not guaranteed.
3. Issues lacking reproduction details may be closed after request-for-info.
